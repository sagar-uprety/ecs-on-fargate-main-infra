## Overview

This repository contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for deploying a Node.JS microservices architecture using AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate launch type. The infrastructure is designed following AWS best practices for high availability, scalability, and security.

The application is a simple e-commerce application with user details, product catalogue and order service. The 

## Architecture 

![AWS Architecture](./ecs-on-fargate-architecture.png)


The infrastructure implements a microservices architecture with the following key components:

- **VPC Configuration**
  - Dual Availability Zones (us-east-2a, us-east-2b)
  - Public and Private Subnets
  - NAT Gateways for private subnet connectivity
  - Internet Gateway for public access

- **Container Infrastructure**
  - ECS Fargate Cluster
  - ECS Services (Three Microservices) and Task (# Note: each microservice have it's own repo. Check them below)
  - Application Load Balancer
  - Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
  - Service Discovery

- **Microservices**
  - User Service (Port 3000)
  - Product Service (Port 3001)
  - Order Service (Port 3002)

- **Monitoring & Security**
  - CloudWatch Integration
  - Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  - Security Groups
  - Network ACLs

- **Data Layer**
  - Amazon DyanamoDB (3 Tables)
    - User Table
    - Product Table
    - Order Table

- **CI/CD**
  - AWS Codepipeline 
  - AWS Codebuild (also builds the microservices docker images)
  - GitHub as the source code repository

## Network Configuration

- VPC CIDR: 10.0.0.0/16
- Public Subnet 1: 10.0.0.0/16
- Public Subnet 2: 10.0.1.0/16
- Private Subnet 1: 10.0.32.0/19
- Private Subnet 2: 10.0.32.0/19

- **ms**: Base infrastructure without pipeline integration

## Related Microservices Repositories

The terraform configuration to deploy the individual ECS services with CI/CD built-in are in separate repositories. Find them below:

1. [User Service](https://github.com/sagar-uprety/ecs-on-fargate-user-service)
2. [Product Service](https://github.com/sagar-uprety/ecs-on-fargate-product-service)
3. [Order Service](https://github.com/sagar-uprety/ecs-on-fargate-order-service)

## Deployment Instructions (Quick Start Guide)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sagar-uprety/ecs-on-fargate-main-infra
   cd ecs-on-fargate-main-infra
   ```

2. Select the appropriate branch:
   ```bash
   # For pipeline version (CI/CD)
   git checkout main
   
   # For non-pipeline version (without CI/CD)
   git checkout ms
   ```

3. You need an S3 bucket as a backend for Terraform state. Create one if you have not already and update the  backend configuration in `versions.tf`:
   ```bash
   ...
   backend "s3" {
      bucket  = "dev-terraform-state-bucket" # update the bucket name here
      region  = "us-east-2"
      encrypt = true
      key     = "main/ecs-on-fargate-main.tfstate"
   }
   ...
   ```   

4. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. Configure your deployment:
   ```bash
   # Edit dev.tfvars with your configuration
   ```


5. Review the deployment plan:
   ```bash
   terraform plan --var-file="dev.tfvars"
   ```

6. Apply the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform apply --var-file="dev.tfvars"
   ```

7. To destroy the infrastructure:
   ```bash
   terraform destroy --var-file="dev.tfvars"
   ```
